      (Holy) 
      (Holy)
    </p>

    <p>
      A thousand generations falling down in worship 
      To sing the song of ages to the Lamb 
      And all who've gone before us and all who will believe 
      Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
    </p>

    <p>
      Your name is the highest 
      Your name is the greatest 
      Your name stands above them all 
      All thrones and dominions 
      All powers and positions 
      Your name stands above them all
    </p>

    <p>
      And the angels cry holy 
      All creation cries holy 
      You are lifted high, holy 
      Holy forever
    </p>

    <p>
      If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed 
      Sing the song forever to the Lamb 
      If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name 
      Sing the song forever to the Lamb 
      We'll sing the song forever and amen
    </p>

    <p>
      And the angels cry holy 
      All creation cries holy 
      You are lifted high, holy 
      Holy forever
    </p>

    <p>
      Hear Your people sing holy 
      To the King of kings, holy 
      You will always be holy 
      Holy forever
    </p>

    <p>
      Your name is the highest 
      Your name is the greatest 
      Your name stands above them all 
      All thrones and dominions 
      All powers and positions 
      Your name stands above them all
    </p>

    <p>
      Jesus 
      Your name is the highest 
      Your name is the greatest 
      Your name stands above them all (oh, stands above) 
      All thrones and dominions 
      All powers and positions 
      Your name stands above them all
    </p>

    <p>
      And the angels cry holy 
      All creation cries holy 
      You are lifted high, holy 
      Holy forever (we cry holy, holy, holy)
    </p>

    <p>
      Hear Your people sing (we will sing) holy 
      To the King of kings (holy), holy (holy is the Lord) 
      You will always be holy 
      Holy forever
    </p>

    <p>
      You will always be holy 
      Holy forever

      Let the King of my heart<br>
      Be the mountain where I run<br>
      The fountain I drink from<br>
      Oh-oh, He is my song<br>
      Let the King of my heart<br>

      My Jesus my Saviour<br>
      Lord there is none like You<br>
      All of my days I want to praise<br>
      The wonders of Your mighty love<br>

      Shout to the Lord<br>
      All the earth let us sing<br>
      Power and majesty<br>
      Praise to the King<br>
      Mountains bow down<br>
      And the seas will roar<br>
      At the sound of Your name<br>
      I sing for joy<br>
      At the work of Your hands<br>
      Forever I'll love You<br>
      Forever I'll stand<br>
      Nothing compares to the promise<br>
      I have in You
