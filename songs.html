      Written by Johnson Oatman<br>
      Put to music by Edwin Excell in 1897

    <p>
      When upon life&rsquo;s billows you are tempest-tossed<br>
      When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost<br>
      Count your many blessings, name them one by one<br>
      And it will surprise you what the Lord has done
    </p>

    <p>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      Count your blessings, see what God has done<br>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      And it will surprise you what the Lord has done
    </p>

    <p>
      Are you ever burdened with a load of care?<br>
      Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?<br>
      Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly<br>
      And you will keep singing as the days go by
    </p>

    <p>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      Count your blessings, see what God has done<br>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      And it will surprise you what the Lord has done
    </p>

    <p>
      So, amid the conflict whether great or small<br>
      Do not be discouraged, God is over all<br>
      Count your many blessings, angels will attend<br>
      Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end
    </p>

    <p>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      Count your blessings, see what God has done<br>
      Count your blessings, name them one by one<br>
      And it will surprise you what the Lord has done
    </p>

      Helen Lemmel, 1918
    </p>

    <p>
      O soul, are you weary and troubled?<br>
      No light in the darkness you see?<br>
      There&rsquo;s light for a look at the Savior<br>
      And life more abundant and free
    </p>

    <p>
      Turn your eyes upon Jesus<br>
      Look full in His wonderful face<br>
      And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>
      In the light of His glory and grace
    </p>

    <p>
      Through death into life everlasting<br>
      He passed, and we follow Him there<br>
      Over us sin no more hath dominion<br>
      For more than conquerors we are
    </p>

    <p>
      Turn your eyes upon Jesus<br>
      Look full in His wonderful face<br>
      And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>
      In the light of His glory and grace
    </p>

    <p>
      His Word shall not fail you, He promised<br>
      Believe Him, and all will be well<br>
      Then go to a world that is dying<br>
      His perfect salvation to tell
    </p>

    <p>
      Turn your eyes upon Jesus<br>
      Look full in His wonderful face<br>
      And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br>
      In the light of His glory and grace

      Written by Joseph Scriven in 1855<br>
      Set to music by Charles Converse
    </p>

    <p>
      What a friend we have in Jesus<br>
      All our sins and griefs to bear<br>
      What a privilege to carry<br>
      Everything to God in prayer<br>
      Oh, what peace we often forfeit<br>
      Oh, what needless pain we bear<br>
      All because we do not carry<br>
      Everything to God in prayer
    </p>

    <p>
      Have we trials and temptations?<br>
      Is there trouble anywhere?<br>
      We should never be discouraged<br>
      Take it to the Lord in prayer<br>
      Can we find a friend so faithful<br>
      Who will all our sorrows share?<br>
      Jesus knows our every weakness<br>
      Take it to the Lord in prayer
    </p>

    <p>
      Are we weak and heavy laden<br>
      Cumbered with a load of care?<br>
      Precious Savior, still our refuge<br>
      Take it to the Lord in prayer<br>
      Do your friends despise, forsake you?<br>
      Take it to the Lord in prayer<br>
      In his arms he’ll take and shield you<br>
      You will find a solace there
    </p>

    <p>
      I keep fighting voices in my mind that say I'm not enough<br>
      Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up
    </p>

    <p>
      Am I more than just the sum of every high and every low<br>
      Remind me once again just who I am because I need to know
      Ooh-oh
    </p>

    <p>
      You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
      You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
      And you say I am held when I am falling short<br>
      And when I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
      And I believe (I)<br>
      Oh, I believe (I)<br>
      What You say of me (I)<br>
      I believe
    </p>

    <p>
      The only thing that matters now is everything You think of me<br>
      In You I find my worth, in You I find my identity
      Ooh-oh
    </p>

    <p>
      You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
      You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
      And you say I am held when I am falling short<br>
      When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
      And I believe (I)<br>
      Oh, I believe (I)<br>
      What You say of me (I)<br>
      Oh, I believe
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking all I have, and now I'm laying it at Your feet<br>
      You have every failure, God, You have every victory<br>
      Ooh-oh
    </p>

    <p>
      You say I am loved when I can't feel a thing<br>
      You say I am strong when I think I am weak<br>
      You say I am held when I am falling short<br>
      When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours<br>
      And I believe (I)<br>
      Oh, I believe (I)<br>
      What You say of me (I)<br>
      I believe
    </p>

    <p>
      Oh, I believe (I)<br>
      Yes, I believe (I)<br>
      What You say of me (I)<br>
      I believe
